# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification task using the famous **Iris dataset**. The objective is to classify iris flowers into three species — *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica* — based on their petal and sepal dimensions.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- Train and evaluate a classification model.
- Visualize the decision boundaries and model performance.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes 150 instances of iris flowers, each with:

- `sepal length (cm)`
- `sepal width (cm)`
- `petal length (cm)`
- `petal width (cm)`
- `species` (target class)

It is a built-in dataset in the **scikit-learn** library.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy – data handling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization
- Scikit-learn – modeling and evaluation

---

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Import libraries**  
2. **Load dataset**  
3. **Data exploration & visualization**  
4. **Train/test split**  
5. **Model training (e.g., KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM)**  
6. **Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)**  
7. **Plot decision boundaries or classification reports**

---

## 📈 Results

The trained classifier achieves high accuracy (typically >95%) and performs well across all three iris species.
